# canyoudoxme.xyz
This was a school project where 3 group members worked together with C++, Python, and Node.js to create a website.
Canyoudoxme.xyz focuses on providing the user with the public location data they have given out on Twitter, seeking to show someone if they are at risk of "being doxxed".
Ideally, the website would function similarly to Googling yourself, but with Twitter. We focused mainly on the data scraping and website elements, but this led
to somewhat mixed results with location guessing due to lack of data from the Twitter API and due to a very simple way of parsing location from text.
If continued, we would likely include Natural Language Processing to more accurately get Location Data from tweets, and finetune our two algorithms based on results.
